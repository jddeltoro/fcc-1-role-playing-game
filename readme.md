# Adventure Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game where the player can fight monsters, buy and sell weapons, and even play a secret number guessing game.

## Game Mechanics

The player starts in the town square and can choose to go to the store, the cave, or fight a dragon. In the store, the player can buy health or weapons with gold. In the cave, the player can fight a slime or a fanged beast. The player can also choose to fight a dragon directly from the town square.

The player has health, gold, and experience points (xp). The player also has an inventory of weapons, starting with a stick. The player can lose health from fighting monsters or from guessing the wrong number in the secret game. The player can gain gold from defeating monsters or from winning the secret game. The player gains xp from defeating monsters.

## Monsters

There are three types of monsters: slime, fanged beast, and dragon. Each monster has a level and health. The player fights a monster by attacking, dodging, or running. If the player's health reaches 0, the player dies and the game restarts. If the monster's health reaches 0, the player wins and gains gold and xp.

## Weapons

There are four types of weapons: stick, dagger, claw hammer, and sword. Each weapon has a power level. The player can buy a weapon in the store with gold. The player can also sell a weapon in the store for gold. The player's current weapon can break during a fight.

## Secret Game

The player can find a secret number guessing game. The player picks a number (2 or 8), and the game generates 10 random numbers between 0 and 10. If the player's number is among the generated numbers, the player wins and gains gold. If the player's number is not among the generated numbers, the player loses and loses health.
